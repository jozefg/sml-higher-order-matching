## sml-higher-order-matching

Higher order matching is a simplified version of higher order
unification (which is generally undecidable). Luckily, for JonPRL and
other related applications, matching is just what we need.

I'm trying to implement the algorithm described in "Unification via
Explicit Substitutions: The Case of Higher-Order Patterns" by Gilles
Dowek, Therese Hardin, Claude Kirchner, Frank Pfenning.

It's really broken right now. Mostly because I haven't written it.
